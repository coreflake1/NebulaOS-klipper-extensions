# NebulaOS automatic probe/nozzle pairing primitive (Phase 2 calibration-
# framework mission; bounded-descent contact-safety rewrite, corrected).
#
# The shared math behind NEBULAOS_Z_OFFSET_CALIBRATE: at a physical bed
# point P, take a FRESH automatic BLTouch probe reading, then move the
# actual nozzle over the exact same P and take one or more validated,
# envelope-bounded HX711 contact readings, and derive the probe's true
# Z-offset from the two raw readings.
#
# Derived directly from pinned upstream Klipper (58bd67db...)'s own
# arithmetic, not invented: klippy/extras/probe.py's
# ProbeCommandHelper.probe_calibrate_finalize() computes
#     z_offset = offsets[2] - mpresult.bed_z + ppos.bed_z
# where ppos.bed_z = raw_trigger_z - current_z_offset (manual_probe.py's
# create_probe_result) and mpresult.bed_z is the RAW toolhead Z a human (or,
# here, the load cell) accepts as nozzle-bed contact. Substituting and
# simplifying, the current z_offset cancels algebraically:
#     z_offset_new = raw_probe_trigger_z - raw_nozzle_contact_z
# both measured in the SAME toolhead-Z coordinate frame. Because both
# readings are taken back-to-back in whatever gcode-offset frame happens to
# be active at the time, any currently-active SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z also
# cancels the same way - this result does not depend on it.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bounded-descent contact-safety envelope (Phase 2 mission - CORRECTED)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# A prior version of this file treated the raw BLTouch trigger position
# (ProbeResult.test_z) itself as the "predicted surface" the nozzle would
# hit, and bounded the descent as test_z - max_contact_descent_mm. That is
# wrong, and dangerously so: pinned upstream Klipper's own
# manual_probe.py:create_probe_result() defines
#     bed_z = test_z - z_offset
# test_z is the toolhead Z at PROBE trigger; bed_z is the ESTIMATED
# NOZZLE-CONTACT Z - upstream's own name for exactly the quantity this
# envelope needs to bound against. The two differ by the probe's own
# z_offset, which on this printer's real captured hardware state is
# ~1.795mm - far larger than any sane descent margin. Anchoring the
# envelope to test_z directly was therefore off by the ENTIRE probe
# offset, not a rounding error.
#
# The complication upstream's formula does not have to deal with: this
# workflow's whole job is to MEASURE a new z_offset, so the CURRENT one is
# only ever a prior estimate, of unknown and workflow-dependent quality.
# Two physically distinct cases follow, and the envelope is derived
# differently in each - see _resolve_envelope() below for the exact
# formulas, and PairedMeasurement.contact_mode/predicted_nozzle_contact_z
# for how a caller can tell which one ran.
#
#   ESTABLISHED (a credible existing probe_z_offset is already active):
#     predicted_nozzle_contact_z = raw_probe_trigger_z - probe_z_offset
#     commanded_floor_z = predicted_nozzle_contact_z
#                          - established_contact_margin_mm
#     established_contact_margin_mm is a SMALL, separately-configured
#     bound on how much further than the (imperfect but credible)
#     predicted plane the nozzle may still be commanded to travel - it
#     must not, and does not, also carry the probe's own Z offset the way
#     the old max_contact_descent_mm accidentally did.
#
#   BOOTSTRAP / VIRGIN (no credible existing probe_z_offset - e.g. the
#   real factory default of exactly 0.000, which is a "not yet
#   calibrated" marker, not a physical claim that probe and nozzle
#   trigger at the same Z):
#     commanded_floor_z = starting_nozzle_z - bootstrap_contact_envelope_mm
#     starting_nozzle_z is the toolhead's own actual, known, currently-
#     measured Z right before the descent begins - not a prediction at
#     all, just "how far below where the nozzle already safely is are we
#     willing to blindly search." bootstrap_contact_envelope_mm is a
#     SEPARATE config value from down_min_z (never silently reused as one)
#     and requires its own explicit hardware qualification before a
#     virgin printer's first automatic Z-offset calibration can run at
#     all - there is no invented default for it either.
#
# Both established_contact_margin_mm and bootstrap_contact_envelope_mm are
# read from the CALLER (nebulaos_calibration.py's own config - a
# calibration-acceptance concern, not a raw motion-primitive one), not
# from the ZOffsetProbe instance. Neither has a production default; this
# function fails closed with CONTACT_SAFETY_LIMIT_UNQUALIFIED, before any
# nozzle contact motion, when the one the current case needs is unset.
#
# Every individual contact is recorded as a ContactSample - accepted or
# rejected, always appended, never silently dropped - and the aggregate
# RepeatabilityResult/PairedMeasurement.accepted flag is the ONLY thing a
# caller may use to decide whether to stage a Z-offset, transition to
# COMPLETE, or call SAVE_CONFIG (see nebulaos_calibration.py).

    probe_x_offset/probe_y_offset/probe_z_offset: the registered probe's
    own CURRENT, live configured offsets (probe_obj.get_offsets()).
    probe_z_offset is the prior this calibration run is trying to refine -
    see this module's header for the ESTABLISHED/BOOTSTRAP split it
    determines.

    z_offset_probe: a nebulaos_z_offset_probe.ZOffsetProbe instance (or
    anything exposing the same touch_probe(down_min_z, pro_cnt=1,
    minimum_allowed_z=...)/get_status(eventtime) contract). Owns only the
    raw motion primitive - the envelope derivation lives entirely in this
    function now, not on that object.

    down_min_z: the same absolute stepper-limit-relative depth floor
    touch_probe() has always accepted - kept as an independent, coarser
    safety layer underneath the derived envelope (the tighter of the two
    always wins - see touch_probe()'s own comment).

    established_contact_margin_mm/bootstrap_contact_envelope_mm: the two
    envelope constants (Phase 2 mission, corrected) - exactly one is
    required depending on whether probe_z_offset is credible, and
    whichever is required fails closed with CONTACT_SAFETY_LIMIT_
    UNQUALIFIED when unset. No production default is invented for either.

    max_abs_fit_delta/min_accepted_samples/max_repeatability_range/
    max_repeatability_stddev: measurement-quality and repeatability
    acceptance bounds (Phase 2 mission, §7/§9/§10) - unchanged from
    before, still fail-closed, still optional, still no invented default.

    travel_speed/probe_lift_speed: motion speeds for the repositioning
    moves; None lets toolhead.manual_move fall back to whatever speed was
    last used. Callers should normally pass explicit values.

    Raises the same exceptions run_single_probe()/touch_probe() would
    raise on a HARD failure path (unhomed axis, sensor error, insufficient
    fit data, no valid trigger before the commanded floor, etc.) -
    deliberately does not catch or reinterpret those; only a QUALITY
    rejection (excessive fit delta, out-of-envelope result, failed
    repeatability) is represented as `accepted=False` in the returned
    PairedMeasurement rather than an exception, since the contact itself
    completed safely and the toolhead is already lifted clear.
