# z_compensate - per-print auto-Z-offset orchestration, host-side Klipper extra
#
# NEW code, not a port - Creality's real z_compensate_wrapper.so has no published source anywhere
# (confirmed via GitHub org-wide search, ANALYSIS.md sec 5). Design is inferred from strong
# evidence (ANALYSIS.md sec 7): the real z_compensate_wrapper.so registers no MCU commands of its
# own, it does lookup_object('prtouch_v2') and calls straight into its primitives, and its
# bl_offset config value matches [bltouch]'s own y_offset exactly - consistent with probing at
# the physical point BLTouch already homed, offset by the nozzle-to-probe-tip distance, then
# reconciling the two readings. Named/config-section-compatible with the existing [z_compensate]
# printer.cfg section on purpose - see ../DESIGN.md.
#
# Real production calls this once per print, before BED_MESH_CALIBRATE (custom_macro.py's
# CX_PRINT_LEVELING_CALIBRATION, ANALYSIS.md sec 7) - a per-print thermal/wear fine-tune, not a
# one-time factory calibration. That matters for how the correction gets applied: baking it
# straight into the saved probe z_offset via stock Klipper's Z_OFFSET_APPLY_PROBE + SAVE_CONFIG
# would trigger a klippy restart in the middle of a print-start sequence, which is clearly wrong.
# So by default this only applies the correction as a live SET_GCODE_OFFSET for the current
# session/print - permanent persistence is opt-in (persist_offset) and needs a real, non-
# restarting save command for whichever environment this ends up running under (Creality's own
# stock image has a restart-free CXSAVE_CONFIG for exactly this reason; nothing has confirmed yet
# whether pellcorp's SimpleAF environment has an equivalent - flagged as a real open question,
# not silently assumed either way).
#
# Config-key reconciliation against the real device's live [z_compensate] section (pulled via
# SSH 2026-08-05, see project memory): this section has its OWN tri_min_hold/tri_max_hold
# (1400/2000, distinct from [prtouch_v2]'s own 1000/1500 defaults - a per-feature sensitivity
# retune, not a duplicate), its own probe speed, and the wipe-pad geometry keys
# (clr_noz_*/pa_clr_dis_mm_x/y/noz_pos_*/pumpback_mm/etc). Klipper's configfile errors on any
# option in a section that's never read via config.get*(), so all of these are read here even
# where their effect is genuinely unconfirmed (see "accepted but not wired" below) - pasting the
# real section in without this would make Klipper refuse to even start.
#
# _NEBULAOS_NOZZLE_CLEAN uses *this* section's tuning and wipe-geometry keys, so this
# module calls nozzle_clear.clear_nozzle() directly with its own `config` object.

        BedMeshCalibrate's internals.

        Official-mainline migration (2026-08-17). This used to be
        `self.bed_mesh.bmc.mesh_min` / `.bmc.mesh_max` - reaching through BedMesh's public
        object into `bmc`, a BedMeshCalibrate instance, and then into two of its instance
        attributes. Nothing about that is part of any interface Klipper offers; all three hops
        are internal, and upstream is free to rename or restructure any of them in a routine
        refactor. It still resolves at the qualified pin, but "it happens to work today" is
        not a compatibility contract.

        The obvious-looking public replacement is WRONG and was rejected after reading
        mainline's source. `bed_mesh.get_status()` does expose `mesh_min`/`mesh_max`, but
        `BedMesh.update_status()` populates them from `self.z_mesh` - the mesh currently
        LOADED - and leaves them at (0., 0.) when no mesh has been probed or loaded. The
        configured bounds and the loaded-mesh bounds are different quantities. This call site
        needs the configured ones, and runs at klippy:connect, before any mesh exists; taking
        get_status() would have silently produced a (0., 0.) fallback target - a worse bug
        than the coupling it replaced, and one no offline test of a probed printer would show.

        So this reads the same config keys `BedMeshCalibrate._init_mesh_config()` itself reads,
        through `config.getsection()` - the ordinary, documented ConfigWrapper API that this
        module set already uses for `[printer]` and `[stepper_z]`. The
        derivation mirrors upstream's own: a round bed (`mesh_radius`) yields
        (-radius, -radius)..(radius, radius) with the same .1mm floor upstream applies; a
        rectangular bed yields `mesh_min`..`mesh_max` verbatim. Both produce values identical
        to what `bmc.mesh_min`/`bmc.mesh_max` held.

        Returns (None, None) when `[bed_mesh]` is absent - this whole path is only a fallback
        for printers without a `_HOMING_PARAMS` macro, and `_resolve_z_home_xy()` reports the
        missing-section case itself rather than failing here at config time.

        the exact bed spot BLTouch's probe already touched during Z-homing).

        2026-08-14 (XY-reference mission): this used to be computed purely from [bed_mesh]'s
        own mesh_min/mesh_max - a real, independently-confirmed bug, not a design choice.
        [bed_mesh]'s center has no necessary relationship to where this printer's own homing
        macro (simpleaf/homing.cfg's [homing_override]) actually leaves the toolhead before
        G28 Z probes: that macro's own _POST_HOME_XY moves to the FIXED (not bed_mesh-derived)
        [gcode_macro _HOMING_PARAMS] home_x/home_y (110, 111 on this printer), and neither of
        _PRE_HOME_Z's own two conditional re-positioning branches (klicky's ATTACH_PROBE, or
        the _saf_z_endstop elif) are active on this config, so nothing moves the toolhead again
        before the real probe touch - confirmed by reading both macros directly, not assumed.
        On this printer [bed_mesh]'s own center is (110.0, 112.5) - a full 1.5mm off in Y from
        where Z-homing actually happens, silently skewing every calibration's target point.

        Prefers _HOMING_PARAMS' own home_x/home_y (the actual source of truth for where G28 Z
        probes) when that macro exists and defines them - this is the same object Jinja's own
        printer["gcode_macro _HOMING_PARAMS"].home_x resolves to inside homing.cfg itself, so

        The math: touch_probe() returns the toolhead Z position (in the current coordinate
        frame, where Z=0 is BLTouch's calibrated bed surface) at which the *nozzle* contacts the
        bed. If BLTouch's static z_offset were perfectly accurate this would read exactly 0; any
        deviation is precisely the correction needed - the same 'offset' value stock Klipper's
        own Z_OFFSET_APPLY_PROBE reads from SET_GCODE_OFFSET and subtracts from the probe's
        z_offset (verified against pellcorp/klipper's probe.py: new_calibrate = z_offset -
        offset), so setting a gcode offset equal to the raw measurement is the correct
        equivalent of "reconciling the two readings" (ANALYSIS.md sec 7) without needing to read
        the probe's current z_offset directly. tri_expand_mm (see __init__) is then applied as a
