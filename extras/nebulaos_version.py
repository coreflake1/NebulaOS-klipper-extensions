# nebulaos_version - runtime version-truth printer object, host-side Klipper extra
#
# Clean-Update + Virgin Baseline mission, Phase 6 (2026-08-08, see
# docs/NEBULAOS_PERSISTENT_LIFECYCLE.md). Answers "what is actually running on this printer
# right now" from one place, queryable via Moonraker's ordinary
# /printer/objects/query?nebulaos_version - firmware tag/SHA and kernel/GuppyScreen pins come
# from /opt/nebulaos-version.json (immutable, squashfs-resident, written at build time by
# 04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh); persistent app generation/migration_version come from
# $NEBULAOS_ROOT/system/app-generation.json (written by S04nebulaos-factory-seed/
# S04nebulaos-migrate); Klipper's own commit and dirty state are read live from this checkout's
# real .git directory, since - unlike the other three components - Klipper is the one thing
# whose live state can legitimately differ from what was last recorded (e.g. between an update
# landing and Moonraker's own update_manager reporting it).
#
# Governing rule (the mission's own words): "a healthy system must not depend on dirty git state
# for accepted functionality." This module does not enforce that itself - it has no authority to
# refuse to start Klipper - it exists so that IF the live checkout is ever dirty, that fact is
# visible in one obvious, queryable place (klipper_dirty: true) rather than silently hidden
# behind whatever klipper_sha happens to report. A CI/deployment check (see Phase 8's own build
# verification) is what actually enforces cleanliness before something ships; this module is the
# on-device instrument that makes a violation visible after the fact.
#
# All reads are best-effort and non-fatal by design: a missing or malformed file/git repo must
# never prevent Klipper from starting - this is a diagnostics object, not a safety gate. Every
# field that cannot be determined reports "unknown" (or null for booleans) rather than raising.
