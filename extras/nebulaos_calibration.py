# NebulaOS calibration coordinator (Phase 2 calibration-framework mission;
# contact-safety stabilization rewrite, corrected).
#
# The single [nebulaos_calibration] object that owns the canonical
# NEBULAOS_* public calibration API. Implemented: standalone
# NEBULAOS_Z_OFFSET_CALIBRATE (LOAD_CELL only, bounded-descent envelope +
# measurement-quality/repeatability gating, plus its SIMULATE_BOOTSTRAP=1
# qualification aid - mission §8); NEBULAOS_AUTO_CALIBRATE, the
# fully-automatic preflight->home->PID->nozzle-clean->Z-offset->bed-mesh->
# one-SAVE_CONFIG-restart-and-verify sequence (mission §11), backed by
# nebulaos_calibration_journal.py's persistent transaction journal (mission
# §12) and NEBULAOS_CALIBRATION_CANCEL. Automatic Axis Twist is a final
# product decision to NOT support (see "Axis Twist" section below) -
# NEBULAOS_AXIS_TWIST_CALIBRATE has been removed entirely, not merely
# blocked. The guided Input Shaper/E-Steps workflows (separate commands,
# not part of NEBULAOS_AUTO_CALIBRATE - see the Phase 2 mission
# document's own §13/§14) are NOT part of this slice.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Upstream-first cleanup (Overnight Contact-Safety Stabilization mission)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Manual Axis Twist and manual Z-offset are NO LONGER wrapped here at all.
# There is exactly one way to run each: call pristine upstream's own
# AXIS_TWIST_COMPENSATION_CALIBRATE AXIS=X|Y or PROBE_CALIBRATE directly
# (both their own interactive TESTZ/ACCEPT/ABORT workflows) - this module
# used to offer thin METHOD=MANUAL passthroughs for both, which added a
# second name for the exact same upstream command with no product value,
# and both have been removed. klippy/extras/axis_twist_compensation.py and
# probe.py (58bd67db..., NOT modified, NOT shadowed, NOT monkeypatched -
# see docs/NEBULAOS_PRISTINE_KLIPPER.md) remain fully authoritative,
# exactly as before.
#
# The PID-default-target and bed-mesh-named-profile Python wrappers
# (NEBULAOS_PID_CALIBRATE_BED/_HOTEND, NEBULAOS_BED_MESH_CALIBRATE) are
# also removed. The bed-mesh one was a real duplication, not just a
# convenience: pinned upstream bed_mesh.py's own cmd_BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
# already reads `gcmd.get('PROFILE', "default")` and saves under it
# directly (confirmed against the pinned source, not assumed) - so
# `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE PROFILE=<name>` alone is the exact upstream
# equivalent of what this module's own wrapper did in two commands. PID's
# default-target convenience has no upstream equivalent (TARGET is
# required, no default), but that is a firmware-config concern, not a
# reason to keep Python in this repository - see NebulaOS-firmware's own
# gcode_macro convenience wrappers instead.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Axis Twist: automatic (LOAD_CELL) path REMOVED - product decision
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Phase 2 mission, final product decision (2026-09): automatic (remote
# load-cell contact) Axis Twist is UNSUPPORTED on the Ender-3 V3 KE and
# will not ship. NEBULAOS_AXIS_TWIST_CALIBRATE, axis_twist_bed_points(),
# axis_twist_geometry_preflight(), and every axis_twist_* status field
# that existed only to support that abandoned command have been removed
# entirely (they previously existed hard-blocked, then dead/unwired,
# pending a hardware qualification that was cancelled rather than
# completed - see the real safety incident that originally motivated the
# hard block, _evidence/overnight-hx711-investigation-20260831-233518/
# REPORT.md, and the Aug 31 qualification evidence this decision
# supersedes, _evidence/phase2-axis-twist-qualification-20260831-203913/).
#
# Manual Axis Twist is NOT affected and needs no wrapper here: call
# pristine upstream AXIS_TWIST_COMPENSATION_CALIBRATE (AXIS=X or AXIS=Y)
# directly - see klippy/extras/axis_twist_compensation.py (58bd67db...,
# NOT modified, NOT shadowed). Its own [axis_twist_compensation] config
# section and calibrate_start/end_x/y geometry remain untouched.

    # NEBULAOS_INPUT_SHAPER_CALIBRATE (mission §13). Corrected live
    # 2026-09-03: an earlier draft of this command assumed the ADXL345 was
    # fixed-mounted (matching this unit's own [adxl345] SPI wiring
    # comment in machine.cfg) and ran a single combined `SHAPER_CALIBRATE`
    # pass for both axes - the operator confirmed live that the real
    # accelerometer on this printer is in fact a separate, movable
    # clip-on module, not the fixed one machine.cfg's own comment
    # describes (that comment is accurate about the WIRING/electrical
    # path, just not about whether the sensor itself is rigidly fixed in
    # one physical spot). A movable sensor needs a genuine relocate-
    # between-axes guided workflow, matching this mission's own §7/§8
    # requirement and mirroring NEBULAOS_ESTEPS_CALIBRATE's own 3-call
    # guided pattern (the human step must happen BETWEEN two real
    # measurements, not before or after both):
    #   1. NEBULAOS_INPUT_SHAPER_CALIBRATE            - preflight, home.
    #      Stops here and asks the human to mount the accelerometer
    #      rigidly on the TOOLHEAD now.
    #   2. NEBULAOS_INPUT_SHAPER_CALIBRATE CONTINUE=1 - runs upstream
    #      `SHAPER_CALIBRATE AXIS=X`. Stops here and asks the human to
    #      move the SAME accelerometer rigidly to the BED now.
    #   3. NEBULAOS_INPUT_SHAPER_CALIBRATE CONTINUE=1 - runs upstream
    #      `SHAPER_CALIBRATE AXIS=Y`, then commits both results with one
    #      SAVE_CONFIG+restart+post-restart verification, same journal
    #      pattern as NEBULAOS_AUTO_CALIBRATE.
